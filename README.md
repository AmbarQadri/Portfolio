## 📧 Contact Form – EmailJS Integration

The contact form allows users to send you an email **without a backend** by using [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/).

### 🔧 How to Set It Up

1. Sign up at [https://www.emailjs.com](https://www.emailjs.com)
2. Create:
   - An **Email Service**
   - An **Email Template**
   - Get your **Service ID**, **Template ID**, and **Public Key**
3. In your `script.js` file, initialize the form like so:

```javascript
emailjs.sendForm('YOUR_SERVICE_ID', 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID', form, 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY');
````

> ⚠️ Don’t expose sensitive keys in production or public repos without protection.
